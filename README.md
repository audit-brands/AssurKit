# AssurKit

Open-source SOX-first GRC platform for internal audit and compliance teams.

## Overview

AssurKit is a community-driven, open-source Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) platform designed for internal audit teams, boutique consulting firms, and enterprises that value transparency and control over their compliance tools. Starting with robust SOX compliance workflows, AssurKit provides a solid foundation for risk control matrices (RCM), control testing, evidence management, and issue tracking.

## Key Features

- **SOX-First Design**: Optimized workflows for RCM ‚Üí test planning ‚Üí evidence collection ‚Üí review ‚Üí remediation
- **Self-Hosted**: Complete control over your data with on-premises deployment
- **Modern Tech Stack**: React/TypeScript frontend with shadcn/ui components and Slim PHP backend
- **Enterprise Ready**: Built-in RBAC, audit trails, and evidence immutability
- **Open & Extensible**: Clean APIs, modular architecture, and pluggable integrations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ (for local development)
- PHP 8.2+ (for local development)
- Composer (for local development) - See [Composer Installation](#composer-installation) below

### Running with Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AssurKit.git
cd AssurKit

# Start all services
cd infra && docker-compose up

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# API: http://localhost:8080
```

#### First-Time Setup

When you run `docker-compose up` from the `infra/` directory for the first time, the system will automatically:

1. **Initialize the PostgreSQL database** with the required schema
2. **Run database migrations** to create all tables (users, roles, user_roles, etc.)
3. **Seed comprehensive demo data** including:
   - 4 user accounts with different roles
   - Demo company (Acme Corporation) with business processes
   - Risks and controls with RCM mappings
   - Sample tests with evidence
   - Complete SOX workflow demonstration

#### Demo User Accounts

After the initial setup, you can log in with any of these demo accounts:

| Role | Email | Password | Access Level |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Admin** | `admin@assurkit.local` | `admin123` | Full system access, user management |
| **Manager** | `manager@assurkit.local` | `manager123` | Create/edit entities, controls, tests |
| **Tester** | `tester@assurkit.local` | `tester123` | Execute tests, upload evidence |
| **Viewer** | `viewer@assurkit.local` | `viewer123` | Read-only access for auditors |

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Change these default credentials immediately in production!

#### Customizing Default Settings

You can customize the default admin account by setting environment variables before starting:

```bash
# Create a .env file in the api directory
cp api/.env.example api/.env

# Edit the .env file with your preferred admin credentials:
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin@company.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

# Then start the services
cd infra && docker-compose up
```

#### Database Management Commands

If you need to manage the database manually:

```bash
# Run migrations manually
cd infra && docker-compose exec api php migrate.php migrate

# Seed data manually
cd infra && docker-compose exec api php seed.php

# Rollback migrations (‚ö†Ô∏è This will delete all data)
cd infra && docker-compose exec api php migrate.php rollback

# Access PostgreSQL directly
cd infra && docker-compose exec postgres psql -U assurkit -d assurkit
```

### Local Development

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Backend
```bash
cd api
composer install
php -S localhost:8080 -t public
```

#### Composer Installation

For local backend development, you need Composer to manage PHP dependencies. The `composer` binary is intentionally **not** included in this repository.

**Option 1: Global Installation (Recommended)**

```bash
# macOS (via Homebrew)
brew install composer

# Linux
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

# Windows
# Download and run the installer from https://getcomposer.org/download/
```

**Option 2: Project-Local Installation**

```bash
cd api
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
# This creates composer.phar in the api directory
# Use it with: php composer.phar install
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
composer --version
# Should output: Composer version 2.x.x
```

For more details, visit the [official Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

**Note:** Docker users don't need to install Composer locally, as it's included in the API Docker container.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Slim PHP 4 with PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: MinIO/S3-compatible for evidence files
- **Authentication**: OAuth2/OIDC or JWT
